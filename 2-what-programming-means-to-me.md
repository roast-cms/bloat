I've been doing this for over twenty years. Still, I think that **programming is amazing**. It only helped us get to space but it's transofrmed life on earth monomentously. Banking, taxes, shopping, sports, medicine, education, you name it — nothing remained the same having been digitized.

In the best of moods, I feel like every new project, an idea that I am to bring into pixelated reality is **an adventure**. With JavaScript, I'm competent enough to know how to erect the building blocksk that'll make the app work — but never the minute details. Often, there are unexpected problems that require research. Some of those problems I can not solve in time and so I have to find new ways. But there are also moments of realization that the thing I'm working on could be made even better because of a new technique or a new tool I've discovered along the way.

**Programming is gamified learning.** Figure out how to get past the puzzle and the computer rewards you with something. It works really well as I seem to gobble it up in my late 30s as a person who never completely enjoyed education in school or university.

But, of course, the world of software can be **overwhelming and even terrifying**. Monopolies, governments, and even small businesses spying on citizens — creeps — lies, harrassment, theft, other nasty stuff.

I don't think most humans comprehended what software revolution would do to the world they lived in. I remember adults in my life thinking little more of computer than a toy in a living room. After all, that's what it was in the late-90s Russia. No internet. My way of obtaining software was a trip to the market, where on shabby tables locals would have a huge spread of CDs. All stolen, cracked games and some professional software. It was the only way to get anything onto the family computer and we paid for every copy, so this didn't feel like theft — not even to my righteous grandparents. Noone had a clue at the time.
